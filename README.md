# Snake Chaos House — HTML/CSS/JS Site

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in a browser. No build needed.

## Edit content
- **Workshops**: `js/workshops.js` → put your Google Form URLs in the `link` fields and change titles/dates.
- **Membership buttons**: in `index.html` → replace `href="#"` with your form links.
- **Text**: edit headings and paragraphs directly in `index.html`.
- **Colors**: tokens in `css/base.css` (`--neon`, `--bg-0`, etc.).

## Notes
- Responsive for mobile and desktop.
- Animations: matrix rain (canvas), glitch headline, reveal-on-scroll, SVG snake motion.
- Honors `prefers-reduced-motion` for reduced animations.
